CS-230 Operating Platforms

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The client is an online gaming company called The Gaming Room. They created a game called Draw It or Lose It that plays on the Android system and want us (developers) do design a web-based game version in order to expand to more platforms.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

In my opinion, I did well in recognizing and addressing the client's requirements and design constraints. Understanding the client's requirements is important to ensure they get the program or service that they really need. Knowing the design constraints can help the developer properly design software based on the client's needs.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Working through a design document helped me organize the project into sections that helped me develope the code more effectively. In particular UML diagram helped with the specifics of the code.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would revise the evaluation section of the document. I would spend more time researching each operating platform in depdth and really understand their pros and cons when it comes to server/client benefits and development tools. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user's needs through the project guidlines and rubric. However, the typical way to understand the user's needs is through interviews and personal communication with the company. Understanding the user's needs is important in order to properly create the software to solve their needs. If the user's needs are not understood properly, the developing company could create a whole design, present it to the user, and then have to redesign or completely redo their work when it gets rejected by the user. This costs the user and developing company time and money.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

The first step is understanding the user's needs and listing their requirements. Creating a UML diagram is a great way to envision how the actual code will need to be developed. In this project, evaluating which operating platform to use played an important part. In other projects, evaluating what strategy or what design tools to use could be very useful. Finally, having final recommendations can help solidify the design and give the user a good view into why our development plan will work.
